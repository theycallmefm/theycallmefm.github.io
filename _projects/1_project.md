This project is a re-implementation of the  [KinectFusion](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ismar2011.pdf) paper on CUDA. It is a group project we completed during my Master's studies at TUM for the [3D Scanning & Motion Capture course](https://niessner.github.io/3DScanning/). We were able to achieve real-time reconstruction on a GTX 960M graphics card.
