This project is a real-time 3D reconstruction framework that replaces an object-by CAD model in a 3D scene. It combines [end-to-end CAD model retriveal and alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04201) with [VoxelHashing](https://niessnerlab.org/papers/2013/4hashing/niessner2013hashing.pdf). It was done under the supervision of [Prof. Matthias Niessner](https://www.niessnerlab.org/) as part of a Guided Project for my master's studies. The code is quite old, and there may now be better methods for integrating deep learning models into real-time systems.
