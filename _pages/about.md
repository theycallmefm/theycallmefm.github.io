Hello there! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Chair of Media Technology](https://www.lmt.ei.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich, advised by [Prof. Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.lmt.ei.tum.de/en/people/prof-dr-ing-eckehard-steinbach/), currently working on [6G Future Lab - Digital Twin](https://www.6g-future-lab.de/) project.

I have completed my Master's degree in Informatics at Technical University of Munich, supervised by [Matthias Niessner](https://www.niessnerlab.org/). I was also fortunate to collobaate with [Yue Wang](https://yuewang.xyz/) and [Donglai Wei](https://donglaiw.github.io/) in my Master's thesis at Harvard University. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Sabanci University, supervised by [Müjdat Çetin](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/people/faculty/cetin_mujdat/index.html).

My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning, with a particular focus on 3D vision and its applications. I have experience in 3D reconstruction, scene understanding, and motion capture. I am currently working on mesh editing and reconstruction.

Outside of research, I have a deep interest in cinema, gaming, and music — from arthouse to mainstream. You can find me on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/theycallmefm/) and [Backloggd](https://backloggd.com/u/theycallmefm/) as well(though I occasionally forget to log my activities). I also enjoy video editing for fun.

Feel free to reach out via email if you'd like to connect!
